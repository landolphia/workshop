			<h1>Workshop</h1>
			<p class="top"> Hi,</p>
			<p> I am not exactly sure how you stumbled upon this site but I might as well give you an idea of where you ended up. Right now this site isn't really a site, it's the boilerplate for a site, barely. This is somewhat of a experiment and what I'd like to end up with is a repository of evolving experiments, probably with accompanying diaries. What this site will actually turn into, I'm not sure. </p>
			<p> If you are curious to see where this is headed come back every once in a while, you might even find something you like. </p>
